## Additional information

To be honest, I apologize for the poor look of this bio, but I promise, I will make it better. Also, when I use a bulleted list, no entries are in a particular order. I also want to make a static site to (currently) put at Neocities so I can finally retire my Carrd site. (I don't know much about deploying static sites not generated with Jekyll on GitHub Pages.)
